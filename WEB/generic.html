										<h1>AutoGarden project</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="photo.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p>In autogarden we try to take to any house the possibility of having your own garden and being able to cultivate your own ecological foods. We are a small company and we are trying hard to get this project forward, although it is never easy, we hope you will like it.</p>
									<p>We have chosen kistarted platform because we thought it was the best way to make a project a reality since we can reach a large audience and a public that is interested in helping to grow projects of this type, and also because we know that in the kickstarted community the two parties  benefit and  we can get many people to try our product, thus creating good opinions and more publicity and therefore making the project grow faster.</p>

									<h2>Why 100k dollars</h2>
									<p>One of the main questions of our sponsors is why a funding goal as high as 100k. We have set this goal after a great market research, because in order to carry a cheap and high-quality product we need a good budget for all resources, we do not believe this amount to be outrageous and also we have in mind that in the same platform, that is Kickstarted, they have financed much higher projects..</p>
									<p>With this amount of money we can order, at a good price, the materials and also make an investment in machinery and resources, to obtein a product of quality, we would also have the opportunity to improve the design of the prototype and implement the user manual, packaging and shipping...</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Our team</h2>
									<p>We are a small group of young entrepreneurs, who are in charge of the project, being the creator of the idea and the project  <b> David L. Barrero </b>, who has been in charge of the whole process by creating the prototype. David knows how to program, has knowlegde in electronics, graphic design etc. He is currently studying and <b>Maria B. Fernandez </b> is backed by years of experience and a business career as weell as  many successful businesses</p>

									<h2>Make it healthy?</h2>
									<p>We all know that eating well can help maintain a healthy weight and avoid certain health problems, but diet can also have a profound effect on your mood  well-being; Studies have linked eating a typical diet full of red processed meats, take-away meals, and sugary snacks with higher rates of depression, stress, bipolar disorder and the famous Western anxiety, and may even lead to loss of judgment, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's
Eating more fruits and vegetables, cooking healthy at home, and reducing the consumption of fat and sugar on the other hand, can help improve mood and reduce the risk of mental health problems; In addition, science showed through many investigations that people with memory problems after a time eating healthy regain control of their lifes, although it has been shown that some specific foods or nutrients have a more powerful effect than others, in the general dietary pattern.
A person does not have to be perfect and completely eliminate the foods they like to have a healthy diet and make a difference in the way they think and feel.</p>
